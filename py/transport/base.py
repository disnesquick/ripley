class Transport:
	""" Base class for all bus-to-bus transport protocols.
	
	    A Transport provides the link between Routes. A Transport is defined
	    with an implicit source and destination Bus. These can be the same Bus,
	    although this concept should only be reified in the LoopbackBus. A
	    Transport can handle transfers between any number of Routes but only so
	    long as Route pairs lie on the implicit source/destination busses.
	    A transport takes care of the physical transfer of the binary stream of
	    a fully marshalled message from the source route to the destination
	    route. The Transport takes care of providing the Route objects with a
	    shiboleth, which may be unique to the Transport sub-class, which is then
	    encoded to identify the correct destination Route. A simple counter is
	    provided as a basic identifier but this may be over-ridden.
